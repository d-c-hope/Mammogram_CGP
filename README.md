# Mammogram_CGP

This is an old app I wrote for my masters project. It allows the loading of mammogram files, their viewing, the selction of suspcious areas. These can then be run through a Cartesian Genetic Algorithm classifier or used to train the classifier 

The app is written in C++ with Win32 for the front end. It is unlikely that the front end will run at this stage wihtout some work. However the CGP side should work fine, perhaps with a few small tweaks for the latest version of Xerces XML and Boost. Some time back I started wrapping the CGP code in a Python interface, if I get round to finishing this I'll add it to this repo.

The code is free to use however you'd like
